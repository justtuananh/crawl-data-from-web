After analyzing data and talking to epidemiologists, the Global Times conducted a series of investigative reports into what consequences vulnerable groups, including the elderly, minorities and children would bear when their countries ease COVID-19 restrictions, and what impact such moves would wreak on their medical systems. This is the third installment, looking into the shocking impact of the US' easing of anti-epidemic restrictions on their frontline heroes - healthcare workers. \n\nWhite flags honoring the lives lost to COVID-19 are seen on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., the United States, on Oct. 2, 2021.(Photo: Xinhua)\n\nMendy, a Virginia-based healthcare worker who has been working in the sector for 22 years, has to work long hours and she said the COVID-19 pandemic has \"wrecked havoc in the medical field.\" \n\nWhen she talked with the Global Times via social media, she said that on many days, medical staff work without proper personal protective equipment, and they have to work very long hours - 12 to 16 hours a day and sometimes seven days a week. \"We are always short staffed, we miss lunch and go for hours without a chance to use the bathroom,\" she said. \n\nWhile US President Joe Biden mourned 1 million American deaths from COVID-19 on Thursday, the US has been facing a crisis of burnout among healthcare workers like Mendy. And American healthcare workers who had been fighting the pandemic at the frontline have also become one the most vulnerable groups along with the elderly population. About 3,600 healthcare workers died in 2020, NBC reported on May 6, citing a Guardian and Kaiser Health News investigation.  \n\nThe pandemic may have a long-lasting impact, as some healthcare workers described it as \"long COVID\" for healthcare professionals. \n\n1 Million Graphic: Chen He/GT\n\n \n\nBurden on American medics \n\nWith Omicron infections showing milder symptoms, some experts have considered coexistence with the virus. Some industry lobbying groups also urged relaxation of the mask mandate in public places like on the flights. But the new variant is not that mild, even though the hospitalization rate trended downward in early 2022. Omicron set records for COVID infections in the US, causing a sharp increase in hospitalizations among youngsters. \n\nAnd the average number of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 is up 44 percent from a mid-April low, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing federal data. Some places that have avoided the worst of the pandemic, including Puerto Rico and Northern New England states, are coping with elevated cases and hospitalizations as the latest highly contagious iterations of the virus circulate, the WSJ said. \n\n\"Frontline medical workers are exhausted and burned out,\" Eric Ding from the Federation of American Scientists told the Global Times. He noted that he hopes there will be more care given to airborne risk in buildings via ventilation and air disinfection. \n\nIn addition to the long working hours and growing stress, the medical workers' pay rates do not reflect the rising inflation in the country, Mendy told the Global Times. As she worked at a long-term care facility offering medical-surgical nursing, a COVID unit and an assisted living facility, she said she had seen many of her coworkers quit, change their careers or retire early. \n\n\"It's because the job had become too physically and mentally draining,\" she said. \n\nAs Omicron peaked, the US healthcare system has been \"left broken beyond repair,\" the Guardian said in an article in February. An emergency physician in the San Francisco Bay Area, who recently polled a group of doctors on an overnight shift about their jobs, said that the ripple effects of the virus, such as its impact on patients needing care for other issues, continue to test the limits of the US healthcare system and its providers despite an overall decreased hospitalization rate. \n\nA recent survey from Elsevier Health - a provider of information solutions for science, health and technology professionals - showed that up to 47 percent of US healthcare workers plan to leave their positions by 2025. And experts at the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) shared a similar estimation, saying that the US will come up short on physicians within just a dozen years, by somewhere between 37,800 and 124,000 doctors.\n\nBy one calculation, that is the number of US physicians in direct care who left the workforce between the start of 2019 and the fall of 2021, even before the Omicron wave slammed intensive care units and left too many doctors feeling desperate amid a \"pandemic of mistrust,\" AAMC said on May 4. \n\nA different strategy \n\nAmerican healthcare workers have been facing tremendous stress because the overall anti-epidemic strategy in the US is a mitigation policy, rather than an elimination policy, to curb the peak of the transmission but the hospitalization rate for the past two years remained high, Chen Xi, an associated professor of public health at Yale University, told the Global Times. \n\n\"Although the hospitalization rates have recently dropped, the overall rates over the past two years remain very high, which means the medical staff have been working under stress and have been exposed to the risk of getting infected, which is why many of them have left their positions,\" Chen said. \n\nIn the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, many US hospitals could not provide an adequate supply of beds to meet the demand and the burgeoning Omicron variant is already overwhelming US hospitals because of high rates of hospitalization, Washington DC-based healthcare publication Health Affairs said in an article in February. When looked at globally, the US has relatively low numbers of hospital beds, with only 2.8 beds per thousand people compared to 8.0 beds per thousand people in Germany, according to the publication. \n\nAccording to China's health authorities, China's number of hospital beds per thousand people increased from 6.30 in 2019 to 6.46 in 2020, but this is still behind some developed countries. \n\nLiang Wannian, head of the COVID-19 response expert panel under the National Health Commission (NHC), told a press conference on April 29 that as China has an unbalanced regional spread of population and a lack of medical resources in some areas, a strategy of coexisting with the virus would put too much pressure on medical resources, posing a serious threat to those with underlying diseases, elderly groups, children and pregnant women. \n\nChinese authorities, in accordance with the country's dynamic zero-COVID strategy, recently updated the COVID-19 treatment playbook to reduce the burden on Chinese medical workers. For example, mild cases are isolated rather than being taken to hospital, which can avoid hospitals becoming overwhelmed. \n\nAs the virus variant continues spreading in the US, the hospitalization rate will increase, highlighting the shortage of medical staff, Chen noted. \"In the next phase, the medical workers in the US will still be under a lot of stress,\" he said.

The new e-scooter has solved both problems,\" she said.\n\nIn Jharkhand, locals have for decades suffered from pollution caused by mining and related industrial activities, with researchers and rights campaigners pointing to rising cases of hypertension, respiratory diseases, malaria and malnutrition.\n\n\"The problems are endless - not just for communities living on the periphery of mines but also for those near the [coal-fired] power plants and other industries linked to mining,\" said Savita Rath, a member of Jan Chetna, a community platform that aids mining-affected people.\n\n\"The land, water, air are all polluted. People are suffering, but have no easy access to healthcare. There is a shortage of staff in the primary health centers, medicines are often in short supply and ambulances are not available.\"\n\nIt was during the COVID-19 pandemic, when health workers faced barriers to meeting vaccination targets, that the district administration took stock and did a regional \"needs assessment.\"\n\n\"We realized that our health workers needed mobility support, and it would be key to addressing all other challenges,\" said Ananya Mittal, deputy commissioner of West Singbhum administration.\n\nThe area covered by each health worker is large, he noted, with some hamlets 3-4 kilometers apart. The administration runs 342 health sub-centers and has made the same number of e-scooters available to staff so they can be reached easily, he added.\n\nIn the past, a few states like Telangana in the south have offered health workers subsidies to buy scooters.

They have large indigenous populations with limited access to government services.\n\nTapas Chakma, a scientist at the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Research in Tribal Health, said pollution caused by heavy truck movement around mines and contamination of water sources were key concerns.\n\nA recent study assessing the health of villagers in Tamnar block in neighboring Chhattisgarh state, co-authored by Chakma, flagged rising cases of hypertension, diabetes and tuberculosis in the area, which is home to a number of coal mines.\n\n\"Hypertension is an underlying cause of many heart diseases and there is the stress of living with these levels of pollution that also takes its toll,\" Chakma said.\n\nMany also point to the fact that healthcare workers can often only provide services in some of these regions once a month - something the state hopes to change with the provision of e-scooters that will help staff get around.\n\nTailored to their needs, the scooters have extra storage for medicines and first aid equipment, can be charged \"as easily as a mobile phone,\" and are simpler to maneuver on village roads.\n\nThe state is also looking at the possibility of setting up solar charging points for the scooters in the future.\n\nMinj said it had previously been impossible to interact with patients and other locals on a daily basis, as she aims to do.\n\n\"Villagers often leave early for work and it is important for us to reach [them] at the right time to give them information or check on their health.

The aircraft crew will know what rules apply and it is critical that passengers follow their instructions.\" \n\nAFP"}, {"source": "www.globaltimes.cn", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202205/1265455.shtml", "category": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/world/index.html", "content": "Photo taken on Jan. 18, 2022 shows a full Moon above Split, Croatia.(Photo: Xinhua)\nA Croatian woman who was denied an abortion although her fetus had serious health issues was allowed to undergo the procedure, a minister said on Wednesday, in a case that sparked nationwide outrage.\n\nThe story rocked the European Union country where Catholic Church-backed conservative groups aspire to curb the right to abortion, which is legal until the 10th week of pregnancy.\n\nAfter that period it can be performed if the health of the mother or fetus is seriously jeopardized, as well as in cases of rape or incest.\n\nBut abortion is becoming more restricted as rising religious pressure sways doctors to refuse it citing moral grounds.\n\nNearly 60 percent of gynecologists in Croatia's public hospitals refuse to perform abortion on moral grounds, official figures show.\n\nThe unborn child of Mirela Cavajda was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor in late April, in the sixth month of pregnancy.\n\nDoctors told the 39-year-old, who already has one child, that the fetus would either die or if born would have serious defects, she told local media.\n\nThey advised Cavajda to seek help in neighboring Slovenia.\n\nMeanwhile, four public hospitals in the capital Zagreb refused to carry out the abortion without explanation or saying they could not confirm the diagnosis or lacked the necessary conditions.\n\nBut Croatian Health Minister Vili Beros on Wednesday said a medical \"commission allowed the termination of [Cavajda's] pregnancy.\"\n\n\"The situation is extremely difficult\" as the MRI scan of her fetus' brain showed, he told reporters.\n\nThat is why the commission estimated that \"both medical and legal preconditions for the approval of abortion have been met,\" the minister said in a statement.\n\nAFP"}, {"source": "www.globaltimes.cn", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202205/1265454.shtml", "category": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/world/index.html", "content": "Officials from Para State, northern Brazil, inspect a deforested area in the Amazon rain forest during surveillance on September 22.

This is the second installment and we delve into the shocking impact of the pandemic on adolescents and children in some countries, especially the US, after they chose to acquiesce rather than deal with the disease.\n\nA 4-year-old girl grimaces as she's tested for COVID-19 in Whittier, California on January 25, 2022. Photo: VCG\n\nMore than two years after the novel coronavirus disease outbreak, and behind the whopping COVID-19 death toll of more than a million in the US, there are far more shocking and heart-breaking numbers.\n\nWhereas nearly 60 percent of Americans have been infected with COVID-19 at least once, more than 75 percent of children and adolescents in the country have been infected, according to the results of the national blood survey released by the US' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on April 26.\n\nLife expectancy in the country has declined for two consecutive years since the pandemic began, while about 200,000 children in the country have become \"COVID-19 orphans.\"\n\nAll these figures once again prove that the US, which has never reflected upon nor held any official accountable for such catastrophe, has been seeking comfort in the notion of \"coexistence with the coronavirus,\" which is the world's top \"failed mandate.\"\n\nChinese health experts noted that as a vulnerable group, the protection, treatment, and rehabilitation of adolescents and children requires the joint efforts of parents and the society.\n\nThey stressed that the Omicron variant is not a \"large flu\" and those countries that either chose or were forced to acquiesce in dealing with the pandemic has never walked out of the dark side of the pandemic. Data, examples, and continued calls from their own countries' health experts demonstrate that China's dynamic zero-COVID anti-epidemic strategy helped solve some of the problems that the West has been struggling with, and China's insistence on sticking to dynamic zero-COVID is the current best solution to protect human lives. \n\nRecord numbers of hospitalized children\n\nThe number of children hospitalized with COVID-19 is soaring in the US, especially as the highly transmissible Omicron variant spreads across the country.\n\nAccording to an NBC News analysis, at least nine states have reported record numbers of COVID-related pediatric hospitalizations. The spike in hospitalizations has frustrated pediatric infectious disease doctors on the front lines treating children sick with the coronavirus disease.\n\nIn Singapore, the Omicron strain is currently most prevalent among adolescents, whereas when the Delta strain was more virulent, it was mainly among the elderly and working adults. Currently, infection rates are highest among children aged between 5 and 11, followed by adolescents aged between 12 and 19.\n\nAccording to a report from the Guardian in March, as many as 20 percent of all child deaths from COVID in the US have occurred during the Omicron surge of the pandemic.\n\nChildren seem to be facing increasing risks from COVID-19 even as mask mandates are abandoned across the country, and vaccination rates among children chart at an alarmingly low rate.\n\nSince the beginning of 2022, 179 children have died from COVID-19 in the US, compared with 735 children in the preceding 20 months, according to the Guardian, citing data from the American Academy of Pediatrics. The figures mainly focus on children aged 0 to 17 and were gathered from around May 2020 to early March 2022.\n\nGT\n\nThe under-5 age group saw record-high numbers of hospitalization over the past few months. Omicron hospitalization rates for kids under the age of 5 soared five times higher during Omicron's peak compared with the Delta wave, according to recent CDC research and data analytics.\n\nChen Xi, an associated professor of public health at Yale University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that in the US, in addition to a significant threat to the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions, novel coronavirus disease infections are also quite high among children and adolescents.\n\nEarlier this year, public schools in the US lifted mask requirements and it is now common to see students and teachers not wearing masks on school premises. A large proportion of public schools do not conduct routine COVID-19 testing. In this case, schools become hotbeds for the spread of the virus.\n\nVaccines are highly effective against severe illness, hospitalization, and death among children. But less than 30 percent of children between the ages of 5 and 11 are vaccinated in the US, and a little more than half of children between 12 and 17 are vaccinated.\n\nAccording to Chen, although the US FDA has approved the vaccine for children above the age of 5, the willingness of parents to have their children vaccinated is still very low. \n\nResearch shows only about a quarter of parents in the US have had their children vaccinated against COVID-19. Almost every city in the US, except Philadelphia, requires parental consent to vaccinate children, further reducing vaccination rates among children and adolescents.\n\nSequelae of concerns\n\nThe cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Korea has exceeded 16.8 million, or about one-third of the population. According to South Korean media, the relaxation of COVID-19 control has not only led to infections in a large number of children, but has also triggered worries among many families about whether COVID-19 will have serious sequelae. \n\nAccording to a survey released by the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service in April, in South Korea, 19.1 percent of 21,615 confirmed patients had visited a hospital for treatment due to sequelae.\n\nSouth Korean media also paid close attention to the consequences in adolescents. Their reports showed that after the Omicron variant has quickly spread, more and more parents sought online consultations about their children's continued symptoms after contracting and recovering from COVID-19. \n\nMedical staff of the Sheba Medical Centre prepare rooms for reopening children's COVID-19 ward on January 11, 2022 in the Israeli city of Ramat Gan. Photo: VCG\n\nAmid the panic, some media outlets called for parents to remain calm. A report published by Hankyoreh said further research is needed on whether COVID-19 is likely to cause long-term and permanent damage to children. \n\nThere have been no reports showing that the Delta and Omicron variants would likely cause different sequelae, but the former had caused more severe infections, the newspaper said, citing a professor of infectious diseases. \n\nWang Guangfa, a renowned respiratory expert who had contracted the coronavirus disease as a member of the National Health Commission's expert team in Wuhan, told the Global Times that sequelae should be treated scientifically. It is crucial to have a correct understanding of the sequelae of COVID-19. \n\n\"First of all, it should be clear that sequela is not the disease itself, but the aftereffect of the disease. Second, we have very little research on the aftereffects of COVID-19, and we know even less about the long-term aftereffects. Therefore, we should not blindly hype the issue of sequelae, but rationally and objectively study how serious the sequelae of COVID-19 are. More scientific research is needed to give the answer,\" Wang said. \n\nInability to reflect\n\nIn October 2021, China launched a nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign for minors aged 3 to 11, in a bid to increase mass vaccination and accelerate herd immunity.\n\nSpeaking at the 2021 Summer Child Health Care Event on August 9, Wang Huaqing, a chief expert with the immunization program of the Chinese CDC, pointed out that some children showed severe symptoms after being infected with the coronavirus disease, such as those with underlying medical conditions or those who are very young. The ultimate goal now for China is to establish an immunity barrier through vaccination and children are an important part of achieving the goal. \n\nHowever, children and adolescents' lives lost in the pandemic are receiving less attention in the US as Washington turns greater attention to Wall Street numbers and geopolitical machinations. Driven by the rush to declare that COVID-19 is over, vulnerable groups trapped in the throes of the epidemic in the US appear to have been intentionally or unconsciously forgotten.\n\nIn January, UNICEF reported that more than 616 million students worldwide are still affected by COVID-related school closures, which experts worried could push the world's most vulnerable child populations into child labor. \n\n\"The COVID-19 orphan crisis has gotten relatively little attention; it's a pandemic hidden inside a pandemic,\" Rachel Kidman, a social epidemiologist focused on childhood adversity at the Stony Brook University, told National Geographic, noting that COVID-19 is perceived as a disease mainly affecting older people, so the toll on children left behind is overlooked.\n\nChen pointed out that the pandemic is also affecting the mental health of children and adolescents, which is already a serious problem in the US today. During the pandemic, several studies showed significant increases in suicide attempts and depressive symptoms among American children.\n\nIn a latest article published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases in April, Anthony Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and other NIAID scientists wrote that \"classical\" herd immunity for COVID-19 \"almost certainly is an unattainable goal.\" \n\nChinese observers said that instead of reflecting on and drawing lessons from the pandemic, Western countries have made poor achievements. They have surrendered without hesitation. Fundamentally speaking, they have not taken human life seriously and their actions scrapped the image of \"human rights defenders\" that they had been grooming for years.\n\nA boy receives the COVID-19 vaccine while being held by his mother in Pennsylvania on November 6, 2021. Photo: IC\nAnalysts noted that the failure of the US to fight the epidemic has cost one million lives, and the most fundamental problem is the government's disregard for the lives and basic interests of its people, and the vast majority of the dead are from the lower and middle class, ethnic minorities, and the underprivileged.\n\nLü Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the tragedy of the US is not just in its failed pandemic response, or the sheer number of deaths, but the country's inability to govern and reflect. \n\n\"The underlying cause of US incapacity for governance is the malpractice of its self-proclaimed two-party system. The system is fractious, inefficient, and slow to make decisions,\" Lü told the Global Times.\n\nRight now, the BA.2 subvariant of the Omicron strain is accelerating its spread across the US. \n\nThe US has entered a new phase of a localized epidemic and the situation is likely to worsen again as autumn and winter begin. The diminishing effectiveness of the vaccine over time, increased indoor activity in the fall and winter, and the constant emergence of new variants, could lead to a resurgence in the US, Chen warned. \n\nGT\n\n\n "}, {"source": "www.globaltimes.cn", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202205/1265354.shtml", "category": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/world/index.html", "content": "Bette-May Waine (right) welcomes her granddaughter Mackenzie Waine (center) and family from Australia for a holiday at Auckland International Airport on April 13, 2022.

In our settlements, sustainability must be the goal.\"\n\nGovernment data from 2017 showed 80 percent of homes in rural areas were either wholly or partially made of traditional materials.\n\nIn contrast, 98 percent of urban houses were built using modern materials and techniques.\n\nSince the policy was approved in 2020, Zimbabwe's government has built 700 permanent homes for people displaced by natural disasters, said Nathan Nkomo, director of the Civil Protection Department, the state's disaster response agency, which helped shape the new building standards.\n\nWith help from partners, including the International Organization for Migration, the World Bank and the African Development Bank, the construction drive focuses on Manicaland and two western districts, Tsholotsho and Binga, all areas that have been hit the hardest by harsh weather.\n\n\"We must come up with settlements that meet the requirements of habitable architecture,\" Nkomo said.\n\nThe Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSlowing deforestation\n\nZimbabwe has become increasingly prone to powerful storms over the past few years.\n\nMost recently, in January 2022, Tropical Storm Anna left a trail of destruction across 18 districts and affected more than 1,300 households, according to Nkomo.\n\nHe said most of the houses destroyed in storms were the type locally known as \"pole and dagga\" huts, made of wood, anthill soil and thatch but no cement, so they quickly become soaked and weak in the incessant rains and fall apart.\n\nThe new settlements policy is not enshrined in legislation, but it creates the legal framework for local authorities to introduce by-laws that should bring houses in rural Zimbabwe up to national and international standards, said David Mutasa, chairman of the Makoni Rural District Council.\n\nThe policy says councils should ensure all new builds use materials and methods that are \"economic, sustainable [and] resilient\" - for example, by insisting that homes are built with cement bricks and all construction is registered.\n\nTo curb the negative impacts of house-building on the environment, the policy bans the use of temporary wooden shacks in mining and farming compounds and prohibits building on wetlands, which are vital ecosystems that provide a natural buffer against flooding.\n\nMutasa, who is also president of the Association of Rural District Councils of Zimbabwe, said Makoni council is already making sure all new homes are made of cement bricks and fining anyone who cuts down trees for wood to bake farm bricks.\n\nNationwide, the penalty for unauthorized tree felling is between 5,000 and 50,000 Zimbabwe dollars ($13-$133).\n\nThe process of making farm bricks is a significant contributor to deforestation in Zimbabwe, said Violet Makoto, spokesperson for the country's Forestry Commission.\n\nCostly standards\n\nNot everyone is happy about the new housing policy, with some local authorities saying they have faced pushback.\n\nCost is the major issue, especially when people who use traditional methods can get most of their materials - like wood and soil - for free, said Toriro, the planning expert.\n\nAfter the government built her home in Ndiadzo village, Florence Panda spent $500 to add on three more rooms that comply with the new guidelines.\n\n\"Some people don't have the money to build modern houses, let alone to the required standards,\" she said.\n\nMutasa, chairman of the Makoni council, said he did not know of any plans for the government to help people cover the cost of building to the new standards.\n\nStill, he added, local authorities should stay resolute in their efforts to slow deforestation and stem the practice of makeshift construction.\n\nReuters"}, {"source": "www.globaltimes.cn", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202205/1265349.shtml", "category": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/world/index.html", "content": "File Photo: Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador speaks during a press conference in Mexico City, Mexico, July 1, 2020.

Photo: AFP\nIn the face of intense pressure to end the zero-COVID-19 policy, the horrific outbreak in Shanghai has at last come under control with daily infection rates declining from 20,000 to 4,000 by Wednesday. Heroic efforts by tens of thousands of medical personnel, city workers, volunteers and the firm resolve of the central government to protect the Chinese people from COVID-19 is succeeding. \n\nUsing the Shanghai outbreak as a pretext, the US and Western world's corporate media have again repeatedly slammed the zero-COVID-19 policy in recent days, essentially demanding that China give up zero-COVID-19.  \n\nWe have no wish to deny that Shanghai's government and people were not well-prepared to deal with a novel and unprecedented massive outbreak of the super-infectious Omicron B2 subvariant. Some Chinese netizens and others have proposed that the restrictions intended to quell the virus were too strict, and contributed to unnecessary suffering. Children separated from their parents when they contracted COVID-19 before the policy was reversed; elderly folks temporarily unable to access medical care; and temporary food shortages in some areas, with some lockdowned residents chanting \"we want to eat\" and \"we want freedom,\" are some of the reported incidents. \n\nBut with no precedent to guide them, and in an unprepared city like Shanghai, creating a completely new supply chain to handle food deliveries, medical care, and other daily necessities of 25 million people takes time and mistakes are inevitable. Western media coverage of the genuine suffering entailed in the incidents reported by a minority of Shanghai residents has, however, made little or no mention of strong Shanghai and central government efforts to resolve these problems, nor of the lessons learned.  \n\nTypical is the article entitled \"China's 'Zero Covid' Mess Proves Autocracy Hurts Everyone\" published by the New York Times. \n\nThe article describes a number of difficulties encountered by Shanghai residents, and cites a number of zero-COVID-19 critics both within and outside China claiming that \"the zero-COVID-19 policy harms the Chinese people.\" \n\nWhat this article, and those like it calling for an end to zero-COVID-19, intentionally avoid is the reality that when they call for an end to zero-COVID-19 they are calling for the deaths of 1 million or more people in China, with one look at the COVID-19 death numbers for countries like the US enough to demonstrate this. Due to their government's refusal to follow China's example, more than 1 million Americans have died from COVID-19, while nearly 2 million residents of the EU have also succumbed. Meanwhile, only 4,500 Chinese people have died from COVID-19 due to the implementation of zero-COVID-19.\n\nThis point bears emphasis: The reality that should be at the center of any honest discussion of zero-COVID-19 in American media is that 1 million Americans are dead due to the anti-zero-COVID-19 policy promoted by corporate media journalists, while just 4,500 Chinese people have died under zero-COVID-19. Moreover, thousands of Americans and Europeans continue to die each week from COVID-19. And one out of every 100 persons over 65 have died in the US due to non-zero-COVID-19.  \n\nMoreover, the American association of physical scientists estimates that 10 million Americans are suffering from long COVID, which is the persistence of serious health conditions long after the initial COVID-19 infection is gone. The renowned Mayo Clinic in the US reports that the virus can damage the lungs, heart and brain, which increases the risk of long-term health problems. In fact, large numbers of those suffering from long COVID report persistence even after one or two years, and the longevity of these conditions is not yet known and could last a lifetime.\n\nFailure to include the comparative numbers, and a failure to emphasize or even mention long COVID, in virtually all of the Western media accounts of China's Shanghai difficulties shows irrefutably the motive is not to report accurately on China's COVID-19 policy but to serve two political goals. \n\nFirst, it is intended to prevent Western people from recognizing that there is an alternative proven in China to mass infections and mass deaths, and that their governments have prioritized business profits over people's lives by maintaining business operations no matter the cost in mass infections, deaths, and long COVID.  \n\nThe second political goal is to further demonize China's government as part of the multi-sided economic, military, and information campaign to prepare the Western public to accept further aggressive moves against China, which may even lead to war.\n\nThere is something called a \"lie of omission\" which entails omitting key information in order to convey a false picture of reality. The Western media's accounts of the difficulties and supposed growing public resistance to zero-COVID-19 in China never mention what should be the major news point regarding the global pandemic and China's zero-COVID-19 policy: The stark contrast between millions of COVID-19 deaths which continue to mount outside China and just 4,500 COVID-19 deaths inside China.\n\nFinally, there is no question that the COVID-19 policies of the Western governments promoted by their corporate media, with the US as the exemplar, are fundamentally responsible for the Shanghai surge. The existence of the highly infectious Omicron B2 mutation which has ravaged Shanghai is the result of the US and other governments allowing hundreds of millions of people to be infected with COVID-19, thereby enabling sufficient human breeding grounds for mutations to produce the Omicron B2 subvariant and new and even more lethal variants in the future.\n\nThe author is a Canadian independent researcher specializing in social, political, and information technology subjects.\n\nThe views do not necessarily reflect those of the Global Times."}, {"source": "www.globaltimes.cn", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202205/1265049.shtml", "category": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/world/index.html", "content": "UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet.

the WFP said the Ukraine crisis could further exacerbate the already dire food security situation across countries in the Eastern Africa region.\n\nWFP estimated that the ensuing inflation from the Ukraine crisis could push additional 7 to 10 million people into acute hunger in Eastern Africa in 2022.\n\n\"Already, the region witnessed significant short-term jumps in prices of wheat, bread, fuel and fertilizer and widespread shortages of fuel, the most affected being Kenya, Somalia, Uganda, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Burundi,\" it said.\n\nAccording to the WFP, Ukraine and Russia have

Photo: AFP\nThree million women joined Japan's workforce in the past decade, and it's at least partly thanks to top executive Kathy Matsui, who coined the \"womenomics\" catchphrase that inspired government policy.\n\nBut with many women holding precarious part-time jobs, often in sectors hit hard by COVID-19, she says the world's third largest economy must try harder to tap underused talent.\n\nThat means chipping away at managers' sexist attitudes and challenging Japan's long-hour work culture, as well as encouraging startups with \"more diverse founders.\"\n\n\"We have a very low ratio of female entrepreneurs in this country,\" Matsui, former vice president of US investment bank Goldman Sachs in Japan, told AFP.\n\n\"But if you want to be driving your own destiny, becoming an entrepreneur is one of the best ways to do that.\"\n\nMatsui, 57, is one of the few women at the top of Japan's male-dominated business world, as co-director of a firm founded in 2021 that invests in ethically minded young companies.\n\nThe Japanese-American was at Goldman Sachs in 1999 when she began publishing studies on the economic benefits of boosting female participation in the Japanese workforce, which she dubbed \"womenomics.\"\n\nTo her surprise, the ideas were adopted by former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2012 as part of his signature plan to revive the ailing Japanese economy.\n\nSince then, the proportion of women in Japan who work has risen from 60 percent to over 70 percent, equivalent to around 3 million people, according to OECD figures.\n\nBut even now, only 15 percent of managers at Japanese companies are women, compared to around 40 percent in the US.\n\nPandemic problems\n\n\"Trying to change the mindset and behavior of very established organizations... is not impossible, but it just takes a long time,\" unlike startups which can be more flexible, Matsui said.\n\nRecent progress has been so slow that Japan's government was forced to postpone its 30 percent target for women in management positions by a whole decade in 2020.\n\nAnd like in other countries, the COVID-19 crisis has not helped.\n\nWorldwide, women were more likely than men to report a loss of employment in the pandemic's first 18 months, according to a University of Washington study published in 2022 in the Lancet that analyzed data from 193 countries.\n\nIn Japan, many women juggle looking after children or elderly relatives while working part-time, often in the COVID-19-hit service industries, Matsui said.\n\nShe thinks helping women into full-time roles where they are more likely to be promoted is not just the government's responsibility, but also that of managers.\n\nEvaluations should be \"much more focused on output and performance, as opposed to the time factor,\" and managers should undergo training to tackle prejudices.\n\n\"A lot of times I come across women who are passed over for promotion, because they just got married\" and their boss doesn't want to \"risk\" them taking maternity leave, she said.\n\nAnd it's urgent - as Japan's rapidly aging population causes its workforce to shrink, \"the fastest thing you can do is try to tap into the talent that is staring you in the face.\"\n\nNew perspectives\n\nMatsui grew up in California as the daughter of Japanese immigrants who ran a flower-growing business, which taught her the \"value of work.\"\n\nShe studied at Harvard, where she majored in social studies. After graduation, she won a scholarship to study in Japan - her first time in her parents' home country - and stayed to build a career in finance.\n\nHer \"womenomics\" argument struck a chord with ministers because it offered a new perspective on the benefits of equality, she believes. As well as targets and requirements for large companies to disclose data on gender balance, Matsui has also seen a shift in how the issue is viewed in Japan, from a niche issue to a \"daily topic of conversation.\"\n\nBut she remains committed to her original principles of crunching data and finding solutions, rather than just talking about the problems faced by women in the workforce.\n\n\"You cannot manage what you don't measure,\" she said.\n\nNow, as co-director of the venture capital company MPower Partners, which invests in businesses that prioritize environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG), Matsui wants to grow Japan's relatively small startup scene.\n\n\"Part of why it's so small is because there's not enough diversity, or because [the companies] don't think globally enough. Those are two angles where we at MPower really want to help change,\" she said.\n\nBut firms seeking investment should beware of resorting to superficial tactics like so-called greenwashing: \"We're not so interested in companies just trying to tick the box.\"\n\nAFP"}, {"source": "www.globaltimes.cn", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202205/1264867.shtml", "category": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/world/index.html", "content": "Visiting Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi (L) shakes hands with Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto prior to their talks in Budapest, Hungary, July 12, 2019.

The precipitous drop during the pandemic is estimated to have cost up to 120 million jobs,\" he noted.\n\nThough easy to sum up the devastation in numbers, capturing the overall toll on people, communities and services, is much harder, particularly for many small island states and least developed countries, which remain heavily reliant on tourism to fuel public spending, he said.\n\nLooking beyond the numbers, tourism plays a deeply human role: \"Travel and tourism connect and unite us...builds bridges and facilitates inter-cultural exchanges...[and] fosters peace and solidarity across continents and borders.\" \n\nInventive efforts were made to help tourism weather two years of COVID-19, including \"travel bubbles,\" \"vaccine passports\" and \"resilient corridors.\"\n\n\"As the pandemic wanes, the tourism sector is rebounding,\" he said, speaking of \"the human need to connect, to explore, to experience. However, as it rebounds, it is important that we reflect on its future direction.\"\n\nShahid noted that tourism is important economically, but its effects on the planet, such as carbon emissions, oceans brimming with plastic, and human impacts on ecosystems and wildlife, must also be considered.\n\n\"We know that many of the communities and historic sites around the world that are beloved by tourists are climate and disaster prone and need support to build resilience.\"\n\nAccording to the UN Environment Programme's Green Economy Report, a \"business-as-usual\" scenario predicts that by 2050, tourism will generate an increase of 154 percent in energy consumption for the sector, 131 percent in greenhouse gas emissions, 152 percent in water consumption, and 251 percent in solid waste disposal.\n\n\"We cannot allow this to continue.

One of her earliest memories is of falling into floodwaters as an infant.\n\nRenovations to the house over the years have included adding an additional floor, raising the structure by 2 feet (0.6 meters), and installing a flood barrier.\n\nAuthorities also completed construction of a key drainage and road tunnel in 2007, to guard against flash floods in the capital and help ease traffic congestion.\n\nHowever, after more than three days of near-constant rain in late December 2021, floodwaters rose in about three hours from a trickle in Chong's home to touching the ceiling of the ground floor.\n\nShe and her family were forced to seek safety on the dry upper floor where, in darkness after the electricity was cut, she began frantically calling emergency services on her mobile phone. \n\nNobody answered.\n\nAs trapped neighbors shouted questions and instructions to each other through windows, Chong phoned her local fire station and was told to call the national government helpline.\n\nA quick Google search showed that it only operated from 9 am to 6 pm, she said.\n\nFire crews eventually used a boat to rescue Chong's family from the balcony, dropping them off on higher ground, and in the rain, without additional help, she added.\n\nThey temporarily moved in with family that lived elsewhere in the city, and the next day she returned home with her mother to salvage some belongings.\n\nVanished forests\n\nMalaysia was once entirely covered in trees but nearly half have now vanished, according to green group WWF.\n\nThe country has lost nearly a fifth of its primary forest since 2002, though deforestation rates have fallen in recent years, according to monitoring service Global Forest Watch (GFW).\n\nAnalysts say forest losses may be contributing to the worsening floods, with many of the hardest-hit states also showing the highest deforestation rates, according to GFW data.\n\nAs news reports emerged of rivers and flooded areas awash with logs, opposition politicians called on the government of Pahang state, east of Kuala Lumpur, to check on illegal and uncontrolled logging.\n\nDamien Thanam Divean, vice president of nongovernmental organization PEKA Malaysia, said clear-cutting of forests, to plant crops such as palm oil and durian fruit, had reduced the ability of land to absorb water, worsening floods.\n\nHe called for a change in the national constitution to put forest management under federal control, with funds allocated to states to promote conservation efforts.\n\nMalaysia's Environment Ministry and Prime Minister's Office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nStill, it is difficult to prove that deforestation upstream caused any specific flooding event, said John-Rob Pool, the implementation manager for Cities4Forests, led by the World Resources Institute, a US-based think tank.\n\nDuring heavy rains, however, forests and fallen vegetation slow runoff, allowing more water to enter the soil and reducing the amount flowing downstream.\n\nThat means, \"restoring forests is an absolute no-regret strategy\" whether for biodiversity protection or lowering flood risk, Pool said.\n\nTypically, seasonal floods happen more along the eastern coast of the Malaysian peninsula, said Renard Siew, a climate change advisor at think tank the Centre for Governance and Political Studies, so the floods in December came as a shock to many urban residents.\n\nThey \"never thought the time would come when they would actually have to evacuate from their homes for safety,\" he said. \"That took them by surprise.\"\n\nReuters"}, {"source": "www.globaltimes.cn", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202205/1264804.shtml", "category": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/world/index.html", "content": "Photo taken on Feb. 4, 2022 shows a dust storm hitting the Sudanese capital Khartoum, causing reduced visibility, with the Sudanese Meteorological Authority warning drivers to exercise caution.(Photo: Xinhua)\n\nSudanese entrepreneur Mohamed Samir watches proudly as workers assemble garishly colored rickshaws, unique in the North African nation because they run on electricity in a bid to tackle soaring costs.\n\nIn Sudan, three-wheeler vehicles, tuk-tuk rickshaws for passengers, and motorbike tricycles with a trailer attached for carrying goods - have long been a popular and affordable transport.

In Kenya, there have been many cases of animals such as giraffes or antelopes perishing for lack of water and food, their carcasses rotting on barren scrubland.\n\nIn drought conditions, wild animals will leave their usual habitat for water or food, straying closer to developed areas. \n\nIn central Kenya, big cats were reported attacking herds of livestock, while elephants or buffaloes taking to grazing in local farmland, which have angered the inhabitants.\n\nAFP"}, {"source": "www.globaltimes.cn", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202205/1264797.shtml", "category": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/world/index.html", "content": "A large Mexican flag flies near the border with the US in Ciudad Acuna, Mexico, Sep 24, 2021.

Thank you for helping to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state.\"\n\nDiao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday that the delegation which included House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory Meeks and US House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is quite high level, which showed that the visit was deceptive, as on one hand, facing domestic economic pressure, Biden tried to deceive his voters at home that US won't engage itself in the conflict, and on the other, attempting to increase efforts to support Ukraine to deal with the pressure from his allies following the Kiev visit of President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nAnd it's apparent that the US is hoping to fan the flames with a flood  of aid trying to close the room for negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, Diao said.  \n\nLü Xiang, an expert on international relations and a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday that US hoped Pelosi's visit could show US' long-term support to Ukraine, indicating US enhanced its efforts to prolong the Russia-Ukraine conflict to achieve the purpose of weakening and pressuring Russia. \n\nAfter the visit, the US is likely to increase its aid to Ukraine as Pelosi had said that she hoped to pass a $33 billion aid package for Ukraine as soon as possible, with the amount of aid described by Reuters as \"a dramatic escalation of US funding for Ukraine.\"\n\nLü said that the visit and following aid are likely to escalate the Russia-Ukraine conflict as the $33 billion aid included more weapons and ammunition, with fears that the conflict may spill over into countries including Moldova and Poland.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said to lawmakers last week that if any other country intervenes in Moscow's military operation in Ukraine, Russia will launch a \"lightning-fast\" response, according to the Moscow Times.\n\nWhen the media released the news that Biden was expected to announce another round of military support to Ukraine, worth $800 million, at the end of April, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the US and Western countries it controls were doing everything to drag out Russia's operation as much as possible with \"intentions to provoke the Kiev regime to fight to the last Ukrainian.\"\n\nDiao said for Pelosi herself, she wanted to leave a political legacy through the visit as this was possibly her final term as House speaker.\n\nPelosi postponed a reportedly planned visit to Taiwan island last month after testing positive for COVID-19 and following the Chinese Foreign Ministry's warning of resolute and forceful measures if the visit took place. \n\nDiao warned that it's possible for Pelosi to take reckless moves relating to China, and China should maintain keen vigilance at her following moves."}, {"source": "www.globaltimes.cn", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202205/1260708.shtml", "category": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/world/index.html", "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday that he had discussed defensive support for Ukraine with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nThe two sides talked about the situation on the battlefield and the blocked city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky said on Twitter, adding necessary diplomatic efforts to achieve peace was another topic of the conversation.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Ukrainian leader said he had discussed defense cooperation in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron."}, {"source": "www.globaltimes.cn", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202204/1260686.shtml", "category": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/world/index.html", "content": "Xinhua file photos of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\n\nIndonesia has invited both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the Group of 20 (G20) summit in November, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said Friday.\n\n\"Indonesia is ready to contribute to the peace effort,\" Widodo said in a virtual press conference. \"Indonesia wants to unite the G20.
